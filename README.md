## By Hamoye-Prophet-Team

Many secured scholarships, but they end up losing them. They do not know the total expenses those scholarships demand. The goal of this project by team Prophets is to help predict the Total Expenses for a scholarship using this dataset.

Every machine learning project follows a workflow and phases, depending on the project specifications. Generally, these phases were followed by the team to achieve this result. The phases include:
  * Data collection
  * Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Data Preparation(Feature Engineering)
  * Modeling
  * Deployment.
